    <p>So you might have missed Songkran 2016, or you had an amazing time and want to head straight back to Thailand.
        Well we've got tips for first-timers, plus a few Thai festivals you might not have known about to get your in
        the party mood. Don't forget your camera!</p>
    <br>

    <h2> Songkran Festival </h2>
    <h4>What is Songkran?</h4>
    <p>It's a week-long festival to celebrate Thai New Year and the end of dry season, which is why it's also known as
        Thailand's Water Festival.Thai locals celebrate by cleansing their Buddha statues and temples - this is where
        throwing water has originated from. Thai New Year, and this giant water festival, is a huge public holiday for
        locals and you can definitely expect to get involved - backpackers and holidaymakers are popular targets during
        the water fights!</p>
    <h4>Where is Songkran celebrated in Thailand?</h4>
    <p>Everywhere, there are big celebrations in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket. Bangkok's The Khao San Road is a battle
        zone during this time, so buy a water pistol and get stuck in! You'll usually find barrels of water in the
        streets for refilling your ammo.</p>
    <h4>When is Songkran Festival?</h4>
    <p>Usually held on April 13th - 15th, however celebrations can go on for as long as a week.</p>

    <h2>Loy Krathong</h2>
    <h4>What is Loy Krathong?</h4>
    <p>Thailand's Festival of Lights, is a lantern festival (not to be confused with Yi Peng, see below), held to thank
        the Goddess of Water at the end of the harvest. Loy Krathong in fact means "to float a basket". It's a time to
        cast off any negative emotions you may have been harbouring and bring luck for the next year. Locals send out
        small, ornate lanterns or paper boats, filled with incense, candles and flowers onto the rivers.</p>
    <h4>Where is the Festival of Light celebrated in Thailand?</h4>
    <p>It's celebrated nationally, but festivities are more common in the big cities like Bangkok and Phuket. However,
        if you really want to get in on the action then head to Chiang Mai - it's known as the place to be during Loy
        Krathong. Make sure you stay in a riverside hotel - they'll often put on performances and shows for Loy
        Krathong. Oh, and don't forget to purchase your lantern from local stalls around the time of the festival.</p>
    <h4>When is Loy Krathong?</h4>
    <p>t's held annually mid-November.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://content.skyscnr.com/6a8c94a3031ee57972b3ff6e52eca8a9/loy-krathong.jpg?resize=800px:99999px&quality=75"
         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Yi Peng</h2>
    <h4>What is Yi Peng?</h4>
    <p>It's Chiang Mai's Lantern Festival. This is one of the better known festivals in Thailand, where lanterns are
        sent up into the air to pay respect to Buddha. Similarly to Loy Krathong, it's also said to help you rid your
        own personal demons. Thousands of paper lanterns are sent into the sky, creating a flock of glowing, floating
        fires.</p>
    <h4>Where is Yi Peng celebrated in Thailand?</h4>
    <p>There are two big events in Chiang Mai; one for locals and one for tourists. If you're looking for the lantern
        release (pictured) go to Mae Jo University, where around 5,000 people gather to let their lanterns escape into
        the night sky. The tourist event is less crowded and tickets can cost about Â£70. Families and photographers will
        probably find it easier to attend the ticketed event - you won't have to battle for your seat or tripod space.
        But, if you want to see the beautiful ceremonies and colourful paper lanterns for free then head to the Three
        Kings Monument and Chiang Mai Old Town.</p>
    <h4>November, usually at the same time as Loy Krathong.</h4>
    <img src="https://content.skyscnr.com/8d1db9cfa2d6e4bd18f3124cc004b9e1/thai-lantern-fest.png?resize=800px:99999px&quality=75"

    <h2>Lop Buri Festival</h2>
    <h4>What is Lop Buri Festival?</h4>
    <p>It's also known as the Monkey Banquet Festival, so you can imagine the scene...no? Well it features plenty of
        macaque monkeys who have set up camp in the Khmer buildings around the town. It's believed that these monkeys
        bring good luck, as well as tourism business and good fortune to the province. Every year local residents,
        hoteliers and travellers honour them with a feast. It looks like a Mad Hatter's Tea Party - the monkeys take the
        fruit, sticky rice and treats, eat them, play with them and stick them where they really shouldn't. However, the
        naughty table manners are tolerated for the continued good fortune of the region.</h2>
    <h4>Where is Lop Buri celebrated in Thailand?</h4>
    <p>In the Lop Buri Province. The easiest way to get there is by tour, or bus from Bangkok - it's 90km north of the
        Thai capital. The monkeys' food is usually laid out in front of Pra Prang Sam Yot Temple, while everyone gathers
        round to photograph, play with and feed the monkeys a little more.</p>
    <h4>When is Lop Buri Festival?</h4>
    <p>November - the exact dates for this year have not yet been announced, but in 2015 it was on November 28-29th</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://content.skyscnr.com/92023d9f83594a4cd5fd97419a75c0cd/lopburi-monkeys.jpg?resize=800px:99999px&quality=75"

    <br>
    <h2>Full Moon Party</h2>
    <h4>What is the Full Moon Party?</h4>
    <p>Ok, so it's not technically a festival, but it is the best beach party on the planet. The Full Moon parties first
        started more than 30 years ago, and have evolved to become a 'must do' on most South East Asia itineraries.
        Every type of music is issued from the booming speakers in each bar, the alcohol is served in fishbowls and
        you'll probably leave the evening with a few new best friends. Find out how you can make it 'til dawn with our
        survival guide to Koh Phangan's Full Moon party.</h2>
    <h4>Where is the Full Moon Party in Thailand?</h4>
    <p>There are many versions held on sandy beaches across Thailand, but the official (and biggest) is in Haad Rin, on
        the southeast Thai island of Koh Phangan. If you want to be close to the action and only a short walk from your
        bed once the party finishes at sunrise, stay in Haad Rin. You'll need to either book in advance or arrive a few
        days before the event to make sure you have accommodation, as the island is usually booked out on the night. Of
        course, if you miss Full Moon you could attend Half Moon, or Quarter Moon Parties - there's always something
        going on.</p>
    <h4>When is the Full Moon Party?</h4>
    <p>It's held monthly on Haad Rin Beach.</p>

        <p>Falling on the 15th day of the first lunar month, Lantern Festival is the first significant feast after
            Chinese New Year, so called because the most important activity during the night of the event is watching
            various wonderful Chinese lanterns. And because every household eats yuanxiao (a rice ball stuffed with
            different fillings) on that day, it is called Yuan Xiao Festival. For its rich and colorful activities,
            it is regarded as the most recreational among all the Chinese festivals and a day for appreciating the
            bright
            full moon, and family reunion.</p>
        <p>With a history of over 2,000 years, various traditional customs and activities are held during Lantern
            Festival
            appeal to people of different ages, including watching lanterns and fireworks, guessing lantern riddles,
            performing folk dances, and eating yuanxiao.</p>

        <h2> Watching Lanterns </h2>
        <br>
        <img src="http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/f41544eecd044d61bfbbe773a963cb7d/pengzhou-china-bright-red-lanterns-and-other-chinese-new-year-decorations-e4p250.jpg"
             width="70%">
        <br>
        <p>During the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD), Buddhism flourished in China. So in order to popularize Buddhism,
            one of the emperors gave an order to light lanterns in the imperial palace to worship and show respect for
            Buddha on the 15th day of the first lunar month. During the Tang (618 - 907), Song (960 - 1279), Ming (1368
            - 1644)
            and Qing (1644 - 1911) dynasties, lighting lanterns became a tradition for Chinese people.</p>
        <p>Today, when the festival comes, red lanterns can be seen in the street, in each house, and store. In the
            parks,
            lanterns of various shapes and types attract countless visitors. Visitors marvel that various lanterns so
            vividly
            demonstrate traditional Chinese folklore.</p>

        <h2> Guessing Lantern Riddles </h2>
        <br>
        <img src="http://images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/site1007/20130225/001422373e191294fc1f10.jpg" width="70%">
        <br>
        <p>Beginning from the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279), guessing riddles is regarded as an indispensable part of the
            Lantern
            Festival. People write all kinds of riddles on pieces of paper, and paste them on colorful lanterns to let
            visitors guess. If one has an answer to a riddle, he can pull the paper to let organizers verify the answer.
            Gifts are presented to the people who get the right answers.</p>
        <p>Because this intellectual activity is exciting, people from all walks of life enjoy it.</p>

        <h2>Folk Dances: Lion Dance, and Walking on Stilts</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="http://www.lexica.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/31.jpg" width="70%">
        <br>
        <p>Derived from the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280), the lion dance is an excellent traditional art that adds
            fun to any celebration including the Lantern Festival. Two performing types have formed during its long
            development. In north China, the lion dance focuses on skills, and in the south the lion dance pays more
            attention to the animal resemblance. One actor manipulates a small lion made of quilts resembling a real
            one, and with two persons acting like a big lion, one manages the head part and the other, the rest. Under
            the guidance of a director, the lions sometimes jump, leap, and do difficult acts such as walking on
            stilts.</p>
        <p>Because the acting is always amusing, spectators enjoy it very much. According to ancient custom, the lion
            is a symbol of boldness and strength that can protect people, so by performing the lion dance, everyone
            prays
            for an auspicious and happy life.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="http://www.chinaexpeditiontours.com/upload/201209070145073125.jpg" width="70%">
        <br>
        <p>Walking on stilts, another folk art, traces its origins to the Spring and Autumn period (770BC - 476BC).
            Performers not only walk on stilts by binding them to their feet, but also do some breathtakingly difficult
            moves. As actors impersonate different characters like monks, clowns, and fishermen and perform vivid and
            humorous acts, the art amuses many people.</p>

        <h2> Eating Yuanxiao </h2>
        <br>
        <img src="http://p1.img.cctvpic.com/photoworkspace/contentimg/2016/02/18/2016021817333227052.jpg" width="70%">
        <br
        <p>Yuanxiao, also called tangyuan, is a dumpling ball made of sticky rice flour stuffed with different fillings.
            Eating yuanxiao has become an essential part of the festival. The methods for making Yuanxiao differ by
            region
            and fillings include sugar, rose petals, sesame, sweetened bean paste, and jujube paste. Some do not have
            fillings. Because tangyuan can be boiled, fried or steamed, and each has a unique taste, it is very popular.
            Yuanxiao is round in shape so it is endowed with the meaning of reunion, harmony and happiness. During the
            night of the festival, family members sit together to taste yuanxiao and appreciate the full moon.</p>
        <p>Besides these activities, there is Welcoming Zigu (a kind and poor girl in folklore), in which women make
            straw
            and cloth images of Zigu and say consoling words to her expressing people's goodness and their pity for
            poor. Because appreciating the lanterns offers a good chance for young boys and girls to communicate with
            each
            other, the Lantern Festival is also regarded as Chinese Valentine's Day.</p>

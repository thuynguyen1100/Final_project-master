<div class="content">
    <p>This year, China welcomes the Rooster, crowing in the new year on 28 January 2017. The Rooster is the tenth
        animal in the Chinese zodiac (between the Monkey and Dog), and its arrival marks the 4714th New Year (also
        called Spring Festival) on the Chinese lunar calendar. Let that number sink in for a moment as you contemplate
        your cosmic insignificance!</p>
    <p>Spring Festival is traditionally a family holiday, but there are plenty of ways for travellers to celebrate the
        Year of the Rooster, both in China and abroad. Here are eight tips for having the quintessential Chinese New
        Year experience.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/01/GettyImages-638907052_medium-5bc81adc4e5f.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2> Get down with the Rooster </h2>
    <p>If you were born in 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, or 2005 (you young chick, you!), then you are a Rooster, and this
        year is known as your běn mìng nián (本命年, the year of your Chinese zodiac animal). Other Roosters include such
        notables as the Confucian scholar Mencius, Rudyard Kipling, Amelia Earhart and Justin Timberlake. Folks born in
        the Year of the Rooster are resourceful, observant, hardworking, courageous and attention-seeking. The Rooster’s
        best love matches are the Ox and Snake (maybe not at the same time). Try this seasonal greeting to spread the
        new year love: Ji'nián jíxiáng (鸡年吉祥; Good luck for the Rooster year)!</p>
    <p>Strange but true: Some scholars claim the Chinese zodiac animals are arranged in an odd-even order according to
        the claws or toes on each limb. (Yep, snakes don’t have toes, but the forked tongue counts as two).</p>
    <br>

         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Visit a Beijing temple fair</h2>
    <p>During the first week of Spring Festival, Beijing’s temples and parks throw open their gates for miàohuì, folk
        spectacles that date back over a thousand years. Part religious shindig, part carnival, you can expect folk art,
        acrobats, puppet shows, sideshows, and more. Dongyue Temple's fair is one of the most traditional, unfolding at
        a 700-year old Taoist temple, while the temple fair in Ditan Park has more plush-teddy sideshows than you can
        shake a sparkler at.</p>
    <br>

         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Watch a lion or dragon dance</h2>
    <p>A tradition in south China, lion and dragon dancing have been a fixture of festivals a since the Tang dynasty.
        Closely related to kung fu, these dances demand strength, balance and poise. Dragon dances are performed by a
        troupe who work together to bring the dragon's powerful yet graceful movements to life. In the past, rival lion
        dance troupes would battle each other to win prestige and money (known as ‘getting served’ in today’s street
        parlance). Look out for the troupe performing a manoeuvre called cǎi qīng, meaning ‘plucking the greens’. The
        lion swallows a wad of money but spits out the ‘greens’, blessing all with a Lion King-sized dose of good
        fortune.</p>
    <p>Tip: luxury hotels in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and Chinatowns the world over, are good places to catch these
        spectacles.</p>
    <br>

         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Eat yourself lucky</h2>
    <p>Like any self-respecting festival, Chinese New Year is all about food. Increasingly, restaurants and hotels stay
        open for the traditional ‘reunion dinner’ on New Year’s Eve, so prepare to eat too much. A whole fish is a
        popular choice, as the Chinese word for fish (yú) sounds like the word for surplus, signifying you’ll have
        plenty of riches. Likewise, dumplings are an auspicious dish because they are said to look like silver ingots
        (it’s all about the money, honey). For an extra dose of good luck, wear red underwear. If you happen to have
        been born in the Year of the Rooster, you’d better wear them all year (multiple pairs on rotation permitted), as
        your běn mìng nián is believed to be a year of bad luck. Also, on New Year’s Day, don’t clean anything – even
        yourself – you’ll be washing away the good luck.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/01/GettyImages-73408643_master-4e4a71531dee.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Travel smart, and cheaply</h2>
    <p>Generally speaking, it is best to avoid domestic travel in China at all during the busy Spring Festival transport
        period known as chūnyùn. But if you fly on certain days – between January 28 and 31, when offices are closed and
        Chinese families hunker down together – it can be surprisingly cheap with few passengers, particularly on
        popular routes, such as Beijing to Shanghai. You should avoid trying to head to major cities by public transport
        anything later than five days before or after New Year’s Day, when millions of migrant workers make the mass
        migration home or back to work.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/01/GettyImages-492853514_super-2dd41b46fe29.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Watch fireworks (at least three times)</h2>
    <p>In every village, town and city in mainland China, you can guarantee to see the skies ablaze with munitions, and
        have your eardrums assaulted by the machine gun rattle of firecrackers, at least three times during Chinese New
        Year – 27 January 27, 1 February and 11 February – so you’ve got plenty of opportunities to witness the
        free-for-all chaos. The first of these, New Year’s Eve, is the big one, reaching a crescendo at midnight, while
        the other two days – Chu Wu and the Lantern Festival – peak at about 9pm.</p>
    <p>Factoid: the bangs and red flashes of fireworks are supposed to scare away Nian, a beast that emerges from its
        lair around the new year to wreak multifarious monstrous havoc. Boo, hiss.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/01/GettyRF_166622760-1-abcf2e770a08.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Head to Harbin for the Ice & Snow Festival</h2>
    <p>In China's frigid far north, the city of Harbin has evolved a tradition of ice carving said to originate from
        fishermen freezing water in buckets to make ice lanterns. Fast forward a few hundred years to this psychedelic
        festival: palaces, towers, monuments and statues, all cut from ice, inset with neon lights and laid out on a
        town-sized scale. It’s a simple fact that hurtling down an ice slide shaped like the Great Wall is definitely
        the most fun you can have in -30°C weather. Travel around the Lantern Festival (11 February 2017) to snag
        cheaper flights.</p>
    <br>

         width="70%">
    <br>
    <h2>Live it up at the Lantern Festival</h2>
    <p>The 15th day of the Lunar New Year is the end, my friend, of the celebrations. But it’s also the new year's
        beginning, the first full moon of the Rooster year. During the Lantern Festival (Yuánxiāo Jié), revellers visit
        temples carrying paper lanterns inscribed with riddles. At Shanghai's Yuyuan Gardens & Bazaar, it's a press of
        crowds and colour as themed lanterns of various shapes and styles are paraded through the grounds. The occasion
        is especially loved by kids – expect dancing, music and, of course, stack-loads of snacks. Try dumplings called
        tāngyuán - balls of rice flour filled with red bean paste or peanut butter, and served in a sweet soup. The
        round shape symbolises family togetherness, bringing happiness to all in the coming year.</p>

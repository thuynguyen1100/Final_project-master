<div class="content">
    <p>When Hwacheoncheon Stream, located in Hwacheon-gun, Gangwon-do freezes in winter, locals and tourists alike flock to the stream, carve out a hole in the ice, and begin ice fishing for sancheoneo (Masou salmon). The trout are known to live only in high quality fresh waters. Visitors fishing in the stream can be seen patiently waiting, and then jumping with excitement as they pull their catches from the hole in the ice. Some even choose to jump into the icy waters of the pool built beside the stream wearing shorts and a tee-shirt for barehanded fishing. In addition to ice fishing, the festival offers a plethora of fun activities with the snow and ice. For that, Hwacheon Sancheoneo Ice Festival has become one of the ultimate winter activities for the whole family to enjoy.

	   <br>Fishing in Hwacheon Stream on ice that is at least 30cm thick is the most popular fishing activity at the festival. Wait patiently for the fish swimming underneath the frozen stream to be attracted to the bait by moving the reel up and down. When you feel a tug, calmly pull the fishing line up and place it in the plastic bag. Voila, you have your first catch! International visitors can enjoy fishing in an exclusive section of ice to increase the odds of catching fish.

<div class="content">
    <p>Isolated from the mainland, the Con Dao Islands are one of Vietnam's star attractions. Long the Devil’s Island of
        Indochina, the preserve of political prisoners and undesirables, it now turns heads thanks to its striking natural
        beauty. Con Son, the largest of this chain of 15 islands and islets, is ringed with lovely beaches, coral reefs
        and scenic bays, and remains partially covered in thick forests. In addition to hiking, diving and exploring
        deserted coastal roads and beaches, there are excellent wildlife-watching opportunities such as the black giant
        squirrel and endemic bow-fingered gecko.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> Take a morning stroll in Con Son town </h2><br>
    <p>The islands' tiny capital is a delight to explore on foot, with (almost) traffic-free streets, a couple of
        traffic lights (which don’t work) and a solitary gas station (which closes for a siesta). This is Vietnam in
        the slow lane.
    </p>
    <p>Begin with an early morning stroll along the town’s spectacular promenade, with a horizon-filling turquoise
        ocean on one side and a roster of handsome ochre French colonial buildings to admire on the other. You’ll pass
        the old Gallic customs house where Camille Saint-Saëns composed his opera Brunhilde in 1895.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 10px" align="center"><i>Family on a motorcycle ride past a colonial house </i></p><br>
    <p>Next up, take a peek inside Con Son Market, where you’ve the option of a local breakfast (think rice porridge
        or noodles) and a glass of drip-fed, treacle-thick Vietnamese coffee. If you’re thinking more along the lines
        of a cappuccino and an omelette, head to Infiniti Cafe & Lounge instead, which has an arty vibe and a great
        street terrace.
    </p>

    <h2> Discover the islands' terrible past</h2><br>
    <p>For a good overview of the islands, their environment (the Con Dao are important nesting grounds for sea turtles
        and there are 11 endemic trees) and their role as a concentration camp, drop by the modern Con Son Museum.
        This will prepare you for a tour of the prisons themselves.</p>
    <p> There were once 11 jails. The largest was Phu Hai, where political rebels and criminals were herded together
        naked in the French period; today the dank rooms are filled with emaciated, chained mannequins. This prison
        acted as a revolutionary university for leaders of the People's Army of Vietnam and Vietnamese Communist Party,
        many of whom were incarcerated here by the French and Americans.</p>
    <img src="../../images/condao2.jpg" width="70%"/>
    <p style="font-size: 10px" align="center"><i>The infamous Tiger Cages</i></p><br>
     <p>The most difficult prisoners were singled out for particularly gruesome treatment in the infamous neighbouring
        Tiger Cages, where they were kept in open-roofed pens, beaten with sticks and doused with lime (which burns the skin). O
        ver 20,000 prisoners died in Con Dao</p>

    <h2> Reflect on the beach </h2>
    <p>After a disturbing look into Con Dao's past, lighten your mood with a trip to the beach. Grab a scooter and buzz
        up to the north of Con Son island, past towering granite hills and fishermen’s houses wrapped in wild
        bougainvillea. Nestling in a niche in the coastline close to the airport is the glorious cove of Dam Trau,
        flanked by rocky promontories, blessed with soft pale sand and fringed by casuarina and pandan trees. Feast on
        ocean-fresh seafood (try the crab) at one of the shacks on the shore.</p>
    <img src="../../images/condao3.jpg" width="70%"/>
    <p style="font-size: 10px" align="center"><i>Beautiful Dam Trau beach</i></p><br>
    <p>On the return leg you could drop by the uber-luxurious Six Senses resort (Angelina and Brad stayed here in 2011),
        which occupies a stunning sheltered beach, for a sundowner, or even a gourmet meal. Alternatively, dine in the
        family-owned Thu Ba in Con Son town for delicious Vietnamese dishes (including plenty of choices for vegetarians).
        The English-speaking owner will guide you through the menu and make suggestions.
    </p>

    <h2> Hike the national park</h2>
    <p>Drop by the National Park management office at 29 Vo Thi Sau, Con Son town and get a (free) permit for entering
        the national park. There are many trails but some are closed during dry season (November to February) because of
        the risk of forest fire.</p>
    <img src="../../images/condao4.jpg" width="70%"/>
    <p style="font-size: 10px" align="center"><i>The green, mountainous landscape of the interior is great for hiking</i></p><br>
    <p>The two most popular are the hike to the rocky bay of Ong Dung (where there’s good snorkelling on a fine coral
        reef offshore) and the steep climb up to So Ray, an abandoned plantation with fine views over the islands – it’s
        now home to a large troop of long-tailed macaque monkeys (watch they don’t steal your lunch!). In the forest keep
        an eye out for other wildlife, including black giant squirrels and monitor lizards.</p>

    <h2> Dive Vietnam's best reefs</h2>
    <p>The Con Dao islands' reefs are unquestionably the best in Vietnam, with healthy soft and hard coral, and there are
        also a few wrecks to explore (including a 65m Thai freight ship). You can expect to see a good variety of tropical
        marine life: parrot fish, triggerfish and perhaps a turtle. The best conditions are between January and June but
        diving is possible year-round.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 10px" align="center"><i>The clear waters around the Con Dao Islands provide excellent diving conditions </i>< /p><br>
    <p>Professional dive schools include Dive! Dive! Dive!, a long-established operation run by Larry, who knows the seas
        around Con Dao better than his backyard. The Con Dao Dive Center is another great outfit. Prices are comparable
        whoever you book with: two-dive packages cost around US$140; snorkelling trips about US$40.</p>

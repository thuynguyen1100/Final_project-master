    <p>The lofty snowcapped Kunlun Mountains are veiled in a wispy mist as the train climbs up a steep mountain pass,
        trudging toward Lhasa. Through the window, great expanses of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau roll into view:
        grasslands dotted with black yaks and prayer flags fluttering from gold-topped temples. This is definitely the
        'roof of the world'.</p>
    <p>For centuries, Tibet was cut off from the outside world by its remote location, extreme climate and geographic
        environment. This far-flung region thwarted all but the boldest travellers and explorers — that is, until the
        construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, which connected Tibet to the rest of China.</p>
    <p> Cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai are bustling hives of activity and commerce,
        but you haven't really seen the country until you've trekked in the mountains or enjoyed some face-time with
        elephants or the bold monkeys
        (who will steal your lunch as soon as look at you). Thailand's attractions are diverse and each provides a
        rewarding and memorable experience
        in its own way. </p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/09/GettyImages-142036387-sm-cf3ad41d2069.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">

    <p>Those seeking the romance of Tibet will find the Qinghai-Tibet Railway an evocative journey that transports you
        to a different world, one far from the neon signs and skyscrapers of urban China. The train trundles its way
        through the back country and high mountains of remote Qinghai and into Tibet, snaking past glaciers, peaks,
        shimmering salt lakes and charming villages. Here's what to expect along the way.</p>

    <h2> An engineering marvel </h2>
    <p>The Qinghai-Tibet Railway holds the record for the world’s highest train route, reaching altitudes over 5000m.
        The railway line, which cost US$4.2 billion to build, is an extraordinary feat of modern engineering. Sometimes
        hailed as the 'sky road', the railway traverses a region known for earthquakes, low temperatures and low
        atmospheric pressure.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/09/GettyImages-71730663-sm-7cd64a897638.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">

    <p>As 960km of the line sits at 4000m, the designers and engineers had to tackle three main challenges during
        construction: the fragile ecosystem, the lack of oxygen and permafrost.
        To provide proper aid for the construction workers, the government built dozens of medical facilities and
        oxygen-making stations along the way to alleviate the effects of altitude sickness. The route was also carefully
        chosen to avoid destruction of vegetation and the natural habitations of wild animals, and they tried to ensure
        stability in permafrost regions by installing gravel embankments.</p>
    <h2> The train route</h2>
    <p>Extending 1956km across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the rail journey officially starts from Xining, capital of
        Qinghai province, and ends in Lhasa, capital of Tibet. From start to end, the trip takes only one day (20 hours
        55 minutes to be exact), and there are trains plying the same route every day. It is possible to make stops
        along the journey, but this is not a spontaneous hop-on/hop-off affair. You’ll need to decide your route in
        advance and buy tickets for each leg.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/09/Villages-in-the-distance-sm-2018a303788f.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">

    <p>The journey is a spectacular tour of the elevated highlights of Qinghai and northern Tibet: the boundless
        Qiangtang Prairie, the desolate, golden Gobi Desert and the wildlife-rich Kekexili Nature Reserve (where you can
        spot Tibetan antelope and wild yak).
        There are plenty of dramatic moments as the train zips past spearmint-blue Qinghai Lake, trundles alongside the
        sparkling white Qarhan Salt Bridge, and skirt the edges of the legendary Namtso Lake. But, without a doubt, the
        highlight is seeing the Tanggula Mountains covered with snow all year round.</p>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/09/GettyRF_660581207-sm-850098219d3e.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">
    <p>Passing the Tanggula Glacier, you really get a sense of the altitude at which you're moving. At a soaring 5068m
        above sea level, Tanggula is home to the world’s highest railway station. It will literally take your breathe
        away — the oxygen levels drop by a drastic 60% at this point.</p>
    <h2> Onboard experience </h2>
    <p>The Qinghai-Tibet trains are unique in every sense of the word, even when it comes to design. All the trains to
        Tibet take into account the conditions faced — from the high elevation and lack of oxygen to the low
        temperatures and harsh climate.</p>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/09/Enjoying-the-views-from-the-train-sm-ae3762e57e74.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">
    <p>To protect passengers from high-altitude sickness, trains have an oxygen supply system that increases the oxygen
        in the cabin as the train ascends and cabins have private oxygen-dispensing outlets. The temperature in the
        train is regulated and pressurised and the windows are glazed with a UV coating to protect against the powerful
        high-altitude rays.</p>
    <p>Like most trains in China, Qinghai-Tibet trains are relatively clean, comfortable and have a restaurant
        carriage, toilets (squat and seater), washing facilities and hot water dispensers. As the majority of travellers
        on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway are Chinese, you'll find the train attendants often don’t speak English.</p>
    <br>

         width="70%">
    <h2>What to pack</h2>
    <p>
        It’s best to pack light and carry a backpack to keep your hands free to flash your ticket and passport. If you
        opt for a suitcase, make sure to bring a compact one as train corridors are narrow.</p>
    <p>As the inside temperatures are regulated to a pleasantly warm degree, lightweight, loose-fitting clothes are
        sensible. Slippers are provided for free in the soft sleeper berths.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/09/Hard-seat-sm-88786a47904e.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470"
         width="70%">
    <p>
        RWhile travelling by train lowers the risk of altitude sickness (as you’re easing into high altitude), many
        passengers still suffer. Pack medication such as Diamox (Acetazolamide), which can help alleviate symptoms.
        You won’t need to pack much food as the train has a food cart and restaurant carriage, but you can carry on
        snacks, too. Instant noodles, sachets of oatmeal, tea bags and soup can be made using on-board hot water
        dispensers.</p>

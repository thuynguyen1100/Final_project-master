    <p>A journey to China’s southwest province of Yunnan is a journey into the colourful cultures of the region’s Bai,
        Yi and Naxi people, labyrinthine and historic old towns in the shadow of snow-capped peaks, and flavour-packed
        street food and local markets.</p>
    <p>Yunnan is a popular region for visitors, especially with Chinese tourists, so the following places are
        recommended for their winning combination of all the best aspects of the region but with smaller crowds.</p>
    <h2> Shaxi</h2>
    <p>
        Sitting in a fertile river valley surrounded by mountains, the ancient town of Shaxi was an important stop on
        China’s fabled Tea Horse Road: tea caravans borne by horses, mules and yaks negotiated a spidery network of
        trails through jungle and mountains to link southwest China with India via Tibet. Sugar, salt, and the tenets of
        Buddhism and Christianity were also transported by merchants, monks and missionaries, and Shaxi’s
        long-established Friday morning market is still the region’s most important trading occasion. Bai people from
        nearby valleys are joined each week by Yi villagers travelling from more remote mountain settlements, and
        Shaxi’s arcing main street is packed with buyers and sellers grabbing a quick breakfast of noodles or steamed
        buns before settling down to essential negotiations. </p>
    <br>
    <img src="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-671895789_full-90067f130d35.jpg"
         width="70%">
    <p>In Shaxi’s old town around Sideng Jie, centuries-old mudbrick houses frame narrow laneways, and the steady but
        inevitable gentrification that produces cafes, guesthouses and boutique hotels is, at least for now, tempered by
        a sleepily authentic ambience where horse-riding Shaxi cowboys can still be seen carefully negotiating the
        downhill path to the town’s main square. Ancient trees bookend the square’s ancient heritage structures, and the
        local police relaxing in the shadow of the colourful Xingjiao Temple seem as laid-back as Shaxi’s sun-loving
        cats and lazy dogs.</p>
    <p> For a taste of traditional Bai food, seek out Orange Restaurant on Sideng Jie’s square, popular with Chinese and
        foreign visitors (the English menu probably helps).</p>
    <br>
    <h2> Baisha</h2>
    <p>Courtesy of direct flights from China’s eastern seaboard, Lijiang is an incredibly popular destination for
        domestic travellers – tens of millions visit the old town warren of souvenir shops, boutique inns and karaoke
        bars every year – but only a handful venture just 10km north to the small town of Baisha. With the audacious
        profile of Yulong Xueshan (Jade Dragon Snow Mountain) as a backdrop, cycling to Baisha is a pleasant way to get
        there and to escape from Lijiang, swapping crowded tangles of lanes and canals for wider and quieter streets
        perfect for independent exploration.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-154417927_full-fe465b1ca504.jpg"
         width="70%">
    <p>Local musicians from Yunnan’s Naxi people play in simple pavilions – Baisha Xiyue or Baisha Fine Music is a
        classical form unique to the broader Lijiang area – and a courtyard house conceals the Baisha Naxi Embroidery
        Institute, showcasing and protecting the art of traditional Naxi embroidery. A short walk reveals the Baisha
        frescoes, more than 50 murals informed by Tibetan Buddhism filling a slightly ramshackle collection of overgrown
        temples adorned, in season, with cherry blossom.</p>
    <p> Simple restaurants, butchers and spice shops sit next to dusty antique emporia on Baisha’s cobblestoned main
        street, while a pair of cafes offering the traveller's holy trinity of espresso, wi-fi and freshly-squeezed
        juice hints at the changes ahead for this ancient Naxi town.</p>
    <h2> Xizhou</h2>
    <p>At the southern end of Erhai Lake, Dali Old Town is often overrun with Chinese travellers. Go just 18km north,
        though, and the village of Xizhou is a quieter and option for experiencing the culture of the local Bai people.
        It’s certainly not undiscovered – honeymooners being photographed in traditional garb amid Xizhou’s heritage
        architecture are ubiquitous on spring and summer weekends – but a weekday visit allows relaxed exploration of
        local markets and the ornate family mansions and temples of early 20th-century traders, along with the chance to
        try baba (savoury Bai pancakes), available from all good street vendors.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2017/08/Xizhou2-cb1aaaa5270c.jpg"
         width="70%">

    <p>To spend the night, head to the Linden Centre, a boutique hotel housed in the former home of Yang Pinxiang, a
        well-off businessman who traded silk and tea on the Tea Horse Road. Under the leviathan Cangshan mountain range,
        the centre, arrayed across four heritage courtyards, is located amid a rural landscape on the outskirts of the
        village and owned by long-time China residents Brian and Jeanne Linden. They’ve also recently restored another
        historic Xizhou mansion as the Linden Commons, a sprawling 1939 building that houses guest accommodation, a
        garden restaurant and an artisan bakery.
        Guandu

        With China’s fifth busiest airport, high-end shopping malls and a future as the economic capital of the greater
        Mekong region, Kunming is one of China’s most dynamic cities, but 8km south of downtown is a surprising area
        that stands in huge contrast to Kunming’s growth and energy.</p>

    <h2> Baisha </h2>
    <p>Courtesy of direct flights from China’s eastern seaboard, Lijiang is an incredibly popular destination for
        domestic travellers – tens of millions visit the old town warren of souvenir shops, boutique inns and karaoke

         width="70%">
    <p>
        Reached by broad boulevards lined with apartment blocks, Guandu manages to remain a compact village within a
        city, and for recent arrivals from Yunnan’s provinces it’s a less frantic, comforting reminder of their own
        hometowns. Every weekend, Dai people from the Xishuangbanna Region bordering Laos and Myanmar join with Tibetan
        speakers from northwest Yunnan or Bai people from around Dali to recreate a taste of home. Scratchy speakers are
        harnessed for impromptu outdoor karaoke sessions, and Guandu’s elegant bridges and canals are enlivened by elder
        statesmen of music coaxing tunes from traditional instruments.</p>
    <p>
        A trip here is made even more worthwhile for street food fans because of the options for multi-course snacking.
        Feast on chilli-laced squid, fiery lamb kebabs from Muslim street vendors, and the classic Yunnanese dish of
        guoqiao mixian, or ‘Crossing the Bridge Noodles’.</p>
